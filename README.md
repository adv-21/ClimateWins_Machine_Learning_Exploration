# ClimateWins_Machine_Learning_Exploration
For this project I took the role of a junior data analyst for the fictional company ClimateWins.  It’s concerned with the increase in extreme weather events, especially in the
past 10 to 20 years. However, it thinks that even weather extremes could be predicted and planned for using advanced tools such as machine learning. With data from the past century, it hopes to create a model for what the future will hold. 
## Data
Historic Weather Data collected by the European Climate Assessment & Dataset project - Source: https://www.ecad.eu/ 
## Coding Tools

This analysis was executed using Python in Jupyter Notebook utilizing the following libraries:

● Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis\
● NumPy: For numerical and scientific operations\
● OS: For interacting with the operating system\
● Matplotlib.pyplot: Creating visualizations\
● Scipy: Executing advanced mathematical operations\
● Scikit-learn: Machine Learning, linear regression, and statistical modeling\
● Tensorflow: Machine Learning and Deep Learning framework\
● Keras: Interface for building and training neural networks
## Folders

● Project Management: Project Brief and Project Overview

● Data: Contains two subfolders, Original Data and Prepared Data. Original Data contains original data as provided by the sources and Prepared Data contains the wrangled data after it was prepared for analysis. The actual data files not uploaded to GitHub due to file size constraints.

● Scripts: The Jupyter notebooks containing the code executed for analysis.
